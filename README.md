# Trivia Bott
 Bot that posts trivia questions every two hours
To use create a env file named config.env with the following format replacing with your keys

DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
API_NINJAS_KEY=your_api_ninjas_key_here
Also need to put your channel id in so the bot posts in that specific channel
